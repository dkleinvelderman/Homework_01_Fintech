### Financing

Early stage Venture Capital Backed for an undisclosed amount by LoupVentures on May 16, 2019.

### General Information

Masterworks is building a platform to securitize fine art by filing paintings with the SEC. For the first time ever, investors can purchase and trade shares in multi-million dollar works of art by artists like Picasso, Monet, and Warhol.

Founder & CEO Scott Lynn has been investing and collecting contemporary art for the past 15 years. As an early internet entrepreneur with a focus on online advertising, martech and fintech, Scott founded, acquired, sold, or remained controlling shareholder in over a dozen tech companies.

Scott's initial interest in art came from his mom who was an amature painter. Following his early entrpreneurial successes, Scott started  collecting art. The first piece he purchased when he was 19 was one of the largest collections of Picasso ceramics, which he held for a long time before ultimately donating. He learned that a big name does not necessarily result in a gain. Later on Scott made substantial gains in art trading, but realized that the art asset class has historically only been available to ultra-wealthy individuals with millions of dollars to invest in a single work of art. The idea was born to create a new asset class for retail and institutional investors by offering fractional shares of artwork by 'blue-chip' artists like Monet, Warhol, and others.

Next step for Masterworks is moving upstream to larger pools of capital, soon to be announcing a fund product giving investors exposure to art as an asset class as opposed to picking and choosing specific paintings.

## Business Activities

* What specific financial problem is the company or project trying to solve? 
    * Even though art is an asset class that offers needed and sought after diversification of an investor's portfolio, access to blue-chip art investments has been limited to the ultra rich. Moreover, the pieces will be removed from public display when they enter private collections. Masterworks enables blue-chip art investments for virtually anyone whilst ensuring they remain visible to the general public by way of a physical gallery. 

* Who is the company's intended customer?  Is there any information about the market size of this set of customers?
    * Masterworks aims at average, non-ultra wealthy investors looking for alternative assets from a portfolio diversification perspective.

* What solution does this company offer that their competitors do not or cannot offer? (What is the unfair advantage they utilize?)
    * As investment-grade art pieces are typically worth millions of dollars, this asset class has been beyond reach of the average investor. Masterworks enables an investor to purchase shares, representing ownership of a painting similar to how one would purchase shares in a traditional company. The purchase price of the painting will be divided in $20 shares, which will be tokenized on a blockchain and going forward may be traded on Masterworks' own trading platform or other crypto exchanges once they become licensed to trade registered securities.

* Which technologies are they currently using, and how are they implementing them? 
    * To accept payments for shares electronically, Masterworks turned to the payments platform of [Dwolla.](https://www.prweb.com/releases/masterworks_is_partnering_with_dwolla_inc_to_revolutionize_fine_art_investing/prweb15967877.htm)
    * Masterworks' platform uses blockchain technology and is based on the Ethereum blockchain, ERC20 protocol. The platform allows investors to monitor the performance of the painting and their concerning shares over time. As value appreciates, investors can decide selling their shares for a profit. Eventually investors will be able to use Ethereum tokens to complete transactions on Masterworks' own [platform](https://thecollegeinvestor.com/23435/masterworks-review/) or any other crypto-currency exchange licensed to trade registered securities.

## Landscape

* What domain of the financial industry is the company in?
    
    * Investment Management

* What have been the major trends and innovations of this domain over the last 5-10 years?

    * In its 2017 report on the [Innovation in Private Banking & Wealth Management](https://www2.deloitte.com/content/dam/Deloitte/ch/Documents/financial-services/ch-fs-en-innovation-in-private-banking-and-wealth-management.pdf), Deloitte concluded that the wealth management industry in Europe has seen a siginificant and constant decline between 2000 and 2015. Even though the surge of the fintechs in that period lacked so-called innovative 'ambition', digital solutions were being offered essentially making the traditional 'wealth-manager' superfluous. This first step lead to new technologies and disruption in the past few years, specifically in the fields of -among others- [artificial intelligence, democratization of financial advice, automation and personalization, retirement planning and decumulation](https://www.plugandplaytechcenter.com/resources/trends-wealth-management-you-should-keep-eye-on/_).

* What are the other major companies in this domain?
    * One other company that can be identified is Singapore-based [Maecenas](https://www.maecenas.co/). Other than that there are a few digital auction platforms, but these are solely geared towards the auction of art at full price (buy/sell) and do not offer fractional shares. In the general domain of investment management there are other platforms offering opportunities to trade the general asset classes; eg [Robinhood](robinhood.com), [M1 Finance](M1finance.com), [Webull](webull.com), [Binance](binance.com).


## Results

* What has been the business impact of this company so far?
    * On the surface Masterworks appears to be moving towards a disruption of an old and hard to reach asset class. However, the fee structure of Masterworks resembles that of a hedge fund. As such, Masterworks charges [1.5% annual management fee plus 20% future profit](https://www.masterworks.io/), a quite significant fee. Also, even though the art asset class [outperforms the S&P500](https://www2.deloitte.com/lu/en/pages/art-finance/articles/art-finance-report.html) these calculations are based on an index, ie you have to own several paintings to get the desired return. Furthemore, the Masterworks platform has not been fully built out yet. Shortly it will offer the opportunity to trade shares. Because of the aforementioned, various investment ranking sites give Masterworks a [fair](https://thecollegeinvestor.com/23435/masterworks-review/) to [good](https://wallethacks.com/masterworks-review/) rating.

    * Currently, Masterworks acquired six paintings: [Warhol](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1738134/000149315219013454/form253g2.htm), [Banksy](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1781737/000149315219014783/form253g2.htm), [Wood](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1791539/000149315219019439/form253g2.htm), [Katz](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1794758/000149315220000552/form253g2.htm), [Basquiat](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1800977/000149315220004188/form253g2.htm) and [Monet](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1750148/000149315219016415/form253g2.htm). The two latter are currently in offering, the four former are 100% funded. As such, it appears there is a lot of interest in the service Masterworks offers. It goes without saying that it remains to be seen what the returns will be once the paintings sell.
        
* What are some of the core metrics that companies in this domain use to measure success? How is your company performing, based on these metrics?
    * Metrics of success involve the percentage of funding, and gains upon sale. The former appears to be a succes due to 100% funding of the four closed offerings. The gains have yet to show.  

* How is your company performing relative to competitors in the same domain?
    * Unfortunately, the single real peer, Maecenas, isn't very transparent in its offerings, but there is a success story about the tokenization of a [Warhol](https://blog.maecenas.co/blockchain-art-auction-andy-warhol/). The fact that this beta auction raised more than 30% of the valuation made it a success. It seems there is a lot of interest in the market and potential investors are not negatively influenced by the fact that this is a tokenized approach.

## Recommendations

* If you were to advise the company, what products or services would you suggest they offer? Why do you think that offering this product or service would benefit the company? Why are these technologies appropriate for your solution?
    * Instead of buying the paintings and then fractionalizing them, it may be even more interesting for the art-enthusiast and investor to be involved in the actual bidding process; ie bid together with the Masterworks buyers.
    * Going forward I would not limit the platform to paintings. There are many other interesting and worthwile sub-classes. One that may not be as obvious is the classic vehicle class.
    * Incorporating a search tool for undiscovered pieces based on data, eg description crawling and image recognition, may unearth vast opportunities; enabling arbitrage on a global level (eg, paintings in the attic or pricing vintage Alfa Romeo in Italy vs USA).
    * Enable SEPA/iDEAL payments for overseas investors.
    * The 1.5/20 fee approach may be regarded as quite steep. Suggestion would be to explore opportunities in view of a flat fee, especially since the management fee implies uncertainty on the outcome and moves away from an 'in this together'-approach.

* What technologies would this additional product or service utilize?
    * The search tool would require image regoconition, which involves a major step of gathering and organizing data, building a predicitive model and using it to recognize images. Suggestion would be -depending on cost- exploring opportunities to incorporate exisiting tooling from a vendor.
    * SEPA/iDEAL integration can be achieved by utilizing standardized tools. iDEAL for instance is based on the SEPA Credit Transfer and consists of a collection of technical agreements and standards (a protocol) between banks and transaction [processors](https://www.ideal.nl/en/ideal-information/).
